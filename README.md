## üìú Description

### Project Description

This project aims to predict the next Brazilian interest rate (Selic rate) considering various influential factors such as the American interest rate, oil price fluctuations, BRL/USD exchange rate variations, unemployment rate, IPCA (Consumer Price Index for Broad Consumer Market) changes, and economic activity. 

The development of this predictive model heavily relied on both economic expertise and machine learning techniques. Utilizing a wealth of domain knowledge in economics, several business rules were incorporated into the modeling process. The model was crafted using the ExtraTreesRegressor algorithm, which demonstrated superior performance compared to other models.

### Key Variables Considered:
- **American Interest Rate**: Influence from the US interest rate on the Brazilian interest rate.
- **Oil Price Fluctuations**: Impact of variations in oil prices on the Selic rate.
- **BRL/USD Exchange Rate**: Effects of currency exchange rate changes on interest rates.
- **Unemployment Rate**: Relationship between unemployment levels and the Selic rate.
- **IPCA Changes**: Influence of Consumer Price Index fluctuations on the interest rate.
- **Economic Activity**: Impact of overall economic activity on determining the Selic rate.

### Model Development Approach:
The development process integrated economic theories and principles into the machine learning framework. The utilization of the ExtraTreesRegressor model was informed by rigorous testing and evaluation, demonstrating its superior performance in accurately predicting the Selic rate based on the provided variables.

This project stands as an amalgamation of economic domain expertise and machine learning methodologies, combining the best of both worlds to forecast the critical Brazilian interest rate, the Selic rate, with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
